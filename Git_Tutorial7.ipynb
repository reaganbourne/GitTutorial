Git allows collaboration among team members, so that multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time. Git manages the changes made to a code from different team members and merges them. Git also has a \"branching\" feature which allows developers to create separate branches for new features, without affecting the main code. By linking your Git with your GitHub, you can easily make your repositories accessible to others. Having your Git repository linked to your GitHub allows GitHub to serve as a backup if your local machine fails (for example if you delete your entire project off of your local machine).
