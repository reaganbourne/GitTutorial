    "> 2. Configure Git with your name and email address using the terminal/command prompt:   \n",
    "> ***git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"***  \n",
    "> ***git config --global user.email your.email@example.com***\n",

    "> ***git --version***  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Now lets move on to accessing GitHub: \n",
    "> 1. Create a GitHub account through the GitHub website: <https://github.com/>\n",
    "> 2. Create a new repository in GitHub by clicking the \"New\" button on the homepage, and then clicking \"Create repository\" \n",

    "- Since Git allows you to manage changes to your code, it provides a complete history of all modifications made, which makes it easy to revert to a previous version when needed\n",
    "- Git allows collaboration among team members, so that multiple developers can work on the same project at the same time\n",
    "- Git manages merging the changes made to a code, from different team members\n",
    "- Git also has a \"branching\" feature which allows developers to create seperate branches for new features, without affecting the main code\n",
    "- By linking your Git with your GitHub, you can easily make your repositories accessible to others\n",
    "- Also having your Git repository linked to your GitHub allows GitHub to serve as a backup if your local machine fails (for example if you delete your entire project off of your local machine, this can be very helpful) \n",

    "> - once you reah a milestone, you should add the changes to your branch using commit\n",

    "3. *Creating a pull request*\n",
    "> - a pull request is used to notify the people that you are working with that you made changes to your branch and you are ready for them to consider the changes/review the changes\n",
    "> - If they like the changes then they will decide to merge it into their branch\n",
    "4. *Review*\n",
    "> - once a pull request has been made, it can be reviewed by whoever has access to the branch \n",
    "> - pull requests are designed for collaboration \n",
    "5. *Deploy*\n",
    "> - once everything has been reviewed, and any changes have been made, then it is time for final testing\n",
    "> - GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing, before it has been merged with the master/origin branch \n",
    "6. *Merging* \n",
    "> - now it is finally time to merge the code with the master/origin branch! "
