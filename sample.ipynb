There are several different types of distributed version control systems, but Git is great because it is free, open source, has a very low runtime, has implicit backup, and is very secure. Git has great support with branching, merging and pull requests, which allow teams to collaborate and efficiently work with each other's code. While allowing developers to work simultaneously, it also prevents overwriting each other's changes. Git is the most popular and widely used version-control system today.
